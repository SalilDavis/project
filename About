Use Case Selection:
Pose Detection & Correction is a strong choice due to its high practical value and clear data availability.

Plan Outline:
1. Problem Statement: Improve yoga posture correctness through real-time input, preventing injuries.

2. Data Selection:

  - Use publically available datasets, such as the Yoga Pose Image Dataset, which contains photographs of various yoga poses identified by name.
     -COCO Dataset (for pose landmarks) and Human Pose Estimation Datasets.
   -Synthetic data: To replicate real-world fluctuations, augment the dataset using rotation, scaling, and noise.

3. Model Development:

    -Pose Estimation Model (e.g., OpenPose and Mediapipe's BlazePose).
    -Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.
    -Steps:
       -Data Preprocessing: Extract keypoints (such as joints) from photos.
       -Create a convolutional neural network (CNN) or use a pre-trained model.
       -Implement alignment feedback mechanism by comparing detected keypoints to ideal posture templates.

4. Model Performance Metrics:

   -Key metrics: Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and accuracy in pose classification.
   -Visualize misalignment: Highlight incorrect keypoints.

5. Integration Simulation:

    -Create a simple web or mobile mockup showing pose detection feedback in real-time.
    -Use Flask/FastAPI to simulate the API.

6. Submission Checklist:
    -GitHub Repository: Upload code and detailed documentation.
    -Documentation Points:
Problem explanation, data preprocessing details, model architecture, results, and scalability insights.
