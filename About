Use Case Selection:
Pose Detection & Correction is a strong choice due to its high practical value and clear data availability.

Plan Outline:
Problem Statement: Improve yoga posture correctness through real-time input, preventing injuries.

Data Selection:

Use publically available datasets, such as the Yoga Pose Image Dataset, which contains photographs of various yoga poses identified by name.
COCO Dataset (for pose landmarks) and Human Pose Estimation Datasets.
Synthetic data: To replicate real-world fluctuations, augment the dataset using rotation, scaling, and noise.
Model Development:

Pose Estimation Model (e.g., OpenPose and Mediapipe's BlazePose).
Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.
Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Extract keypoints (such as joints) from photos.
Create a convolutional neural network (CNN) or use a pre-trained model.
Implement alignment feedback mechanism by comparing detected keypoints to ideal posture templates.
Model Performance Metrics:

Key metrics: Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and accuracy in pose classification.
Visualize misalignment: Highlight incorrect keypoints.
Integration Simulation (Optional):

Create a simple web or mobile mockup showing pose detection feedback in real-time.
Use Flask/FastAPI to simulate the API.
Submission Checklist:
GitHub Repository: Upload code and detailed documentation.
Documentation Points:
Problem explanation, data preprocessing details, model architecture, results, and scalability insights.
